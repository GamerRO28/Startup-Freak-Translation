My name is Pasithea and I would like to offer you some life changing supplements which I think you have been looking for some time. For a limited time, we are offering our blue pill and red pill collection for half price! The blue pills are fantastic for relaxation, improved sleep, and the closest thing to a cure for insomnia. The red pills will give you that extra boost in the morning and keep you alert all day. 

Typically we would conduct business face to face (that is my son's preferred method), but given the booming nature of this business, email would be the quickest way. Simply reply to this email with the quantity required.

P.S. side effects of the red pill may include vomiting, confusion, increased aggression, fashion change, blindness, and ultimately crucifixion.",
Str_Email_Junk-BritishPrinces_Subject,"YOUR ASSISTANCE - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL",
Str_Email_Junk-BritishPrinces_Body,"Good day,

My name is Ben Dover, attorney of law to the late Princess Charlotte of Wales. I appreciate that the name of Her Royal Highness may be unfamiliar to you; this is because the royal family has, for years, systematically hidden her from the eyes of the public and media due to her unorthodox parentage. Two months ago, when the Princess passed away tragically in a pigeon racing incident (the circumstances of which I still question to this day), she left behind an estate worth two hundred and fifty two million dollars ($252,000,000). This is where I need your help!

As you can appreciate there are those in the royal family who would rather not see this money go to Princess Charlotte's children and wish to bury her legacy along with her. Being the only person working on her behalf, I need your help transferring the full amount to an off-shore account where it can be kept safe. I assure you that my intentions are sincere and that you can trust me. Of course you will also be rewarded for your help. You will just need to follow these simple steps:

1) I will make a full deposit to an account of your choosing.

2) Immediately upon receiving the deposit, you will need to transfer 2 sums to an account which I will provide to you. The first transfer must be for $3.20 and the second for the amount of $7822.32.

3) Shortly thereafter you will receive a package in your mail, from one Pepe Didi. IT IS IMPARATIVE THAT YOU DO NOT OPEN THIS PACKAGE! Please burn it immediately.

4) Over the following three weeks you may notice unusual activity nearby your home, or surrounding streets. Please disregard these and do not be alarmed. Simply ensure your curtains/blinds are closed at all times and stay away from windows whilst at home.

5) At the end of the three weeks transfer 90% of the money ($226,800,000) to the aforementioned account. The remaining $25,200,000 is your reward for helping me with this transaction.


Thank you again, and I trust that you will get back to me very soon.



Yours Sincerely,

Ben Dover",
